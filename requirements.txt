# Jupyter Notebook environment with R kernel
jupyter
r-irkernel  # Jupyter kernel for running R code

# API clients
# If any R libraries exist for these clients, you would typically add those in an R-specific file or within the notebooks.
# For example, if using reticulate or similar, you may add Python packages directly here:
openai  # Official OpenAI Python client (if used alongside R)

# Additional utilities
python-dotenv  # for managing environment variables in any Python code sections

# Custom GitHub repository
